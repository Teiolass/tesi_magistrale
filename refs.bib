This limitation hampers the fairness, accountability and transparency of these models; the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to solve this problem providing human-understandable explanations for black-box models. However, healthcare datasets (and the related learning tasks) often present peculiar features, such as sequential data, multi-label predictions, and links to structured background knowledge. In this paper, we introduce Doctor XAI, a model-agnostic explainability technique able to deal with multi-labeled, sequential, ontology-linked data. We focus on explaining Doctor AI, a multilabel classifier which takes as input the clinical history of a patient in order to predict the next visit. Furthermore, we show how exploiting the temporal dimension in the data and the domain knowledge encoded in the medical ontology improves the quality of the mined explanations.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency}, publisher={ACM}, author={Panigutti, Cecilia and Perotti, Alan and Pedreschi, Dino}, year={2020}, month=jan, pages={629–639}, language={en} }

            Digital data collection during routine clinical practice is now ubiquitous within hospitals. The data contains valuable information on the care of patients and their response to treatments, offering exciting opportunities for research. Typically, data are stored within archival systems that are not intended to support research. These systems are often inaccessible to researchers and structured for optimal storage, rather than interpretability and analysis. Here we present MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database sourced from the electronic health record of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Information available includes patient measurements, orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. MIMIC-IV is intended to support a wide array of research studies and educational material, helping to reduce barriers to conducting clinical research.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Data}, author={Johnson, Alistair E.

         title={Sequential Diagnosis Prediction with Transformer and Ontological Representation}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03069}, abstractNote={Sequential diagnosis prediction on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) has been proven crucial for predictive analytics in the medical domain. EHR data, sequential records of a patient’s interactions with healthcare systems, has numerous inherent characteristics of temporality, irregularity and data insufﬁciency. Some recent works train healthcare predictive models by making use of sequential information in EHR data, but they are vulnerable to irregular, temporal EHR data with the states of admission/discharge from hospital, and insufﬁcient data. To mitigate this, we propose an end-to-end robust transformer-based model called SETOR, which exploits neural ordinary differential equation to handle both irregular intervals between a patient’s visits with admitted timestamps and length of stay in each visit, to alleviate the limitation of insufﬁcient data by integrating medical ontology, and to capture the dependencies between the patient’s visits by employing multi-layer transformer blocks. Experiments conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets show that, our sequential diagnoses prediction model SETOR not only achieves better predictive results than previous stateof-the-art approaches, irrespective of sufﬁcient or insufﬁcient training data, but also derives more interpretable embeddings of medical codes. The experimental codes are available at the GitHub repository1.}, note={arXiv:2109.03069 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2109.03069}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Peng, Xueping and Long, Guodong and Shen, Tao and Wang, Sen and Jiang, Jing}, year={2021}, month=sep, language={en} }
